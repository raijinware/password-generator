This is a password generator that I made on a Saturday morning so that I can have more secure passwords.

Previously generated passwords cannot be retrieved. Therefore, if you use this to generate your passwords, MAKE SURE THAT YOU STORE YOUR PASSWORD SOMEWHERE. Nothing is ever stored in the program, so any passwords generated with this are completely gone once the next password is generated.

I plan on adding more functionality to this project later.
